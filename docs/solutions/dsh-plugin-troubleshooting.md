## Problem

Installing `@lovedolove/dsh-project-memory` into a DSH profile caused `dsh web` to fail with one of three cryptic errors:

1. `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'found'`
2. `TypeError: duplicate loader entry id: project-memory-dsh`
3. `Error: cannot get property "skills" without inject`

All three errors appeared at different stages of debugging, and each pointed to a different root cause.

---

## Root Cause

Three independent mistakes in the plugin's design and the installer's logic:

### 1. JSDoc Comment Closure (SyntaxError)

The plugin's `dsh/plugin.mjs` contained a JSDoc comment with `skills/*/SKILL.md`. JavaScript treats `*/` as the end of a block comment, so the parser saw `found` as executable code:

```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
/**
 * registers every skills/*/SKILL.md found there  -> */ closes comment
 */
// The word "found" is now outside the comment --> SyntaxError
```

**Fix:** Escape the `/` and `*` inside comments: `skills\/\*\/SKILL.md`

### 2. Duplicate Loader Entry (TypeError)

`install.ps1` wrote `project-memory-dsh` into the **profile's** `cordis.patch.yml`, while the plugin's own `cordis.patch.yml` (loaded via `dsh.profile.bundles`) also defined the same entry. Cordis applies all patch layers in a single `EntryGroup`, so the same ID registered twice --> `duplicate loader entry id`.

**Fix:** `install.ps1` only writes a clean empty layer (`[]`) to the profile patch. The plugin manages its own patches via the bundle mechanism.

### 3. Missing Inject Declaration (RuntimeError)

`lib/index.js` exported `inject = []` (empty), but `plugin.mjs:apply()` immediately accessed `ctx.skills`. Cordis uses the module's `inject` export to decide which services to wait for before calling `apply()`. Empty array --> no waiting --> `ctx.skills` not yet available --> error.

**Fix:** Add `export const inject = ['skills']` to `plugin.mjs`. Reference: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill-badge` uses the same pattern.

---

## Solution

### Step 1 --> Fix syntax: escape `*/` in JSDoc comments

```javascript
// In dsh/plugin.mjs, change:
*      registers every skills/*/SKILL.md found there,
// To:
*      registers every skills\/\*\/SKILL.md found there,
```

### Step 2 --> Fix installer: don't write plugin entries to profile patch

```powershell
# In install.ps1, Remove-Plugin-ToProfile should only write empty layer:
$emptyPatch = "# Your patch layer...\n[]`n"
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($patchPath, $emptyPatch, [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))
```

### Step 3 --> Fix inject: declare required services

```javascript
// In dsh/plugin.mjs, add after export const name:
export const name = PLUGIN_ID
export const inject = ['skills']
```

Also update `lib/index.js` if it's used as a secondary entry point.

## Verification (Historical — v0.4.2当时)

- `node --check dsh-plugin/dsh/plugin.mjs` --> exit 0
- `Invoke-Pester install.tests.ps1` --> 10/10 passed
- `dsh --profile web --dump-config` --> loads `project-memory-dsh` correctly
- `npm view @lovedolove/dsh-project-memory version` --> 0.4.2 (当时)

> Note: The current published version is `0.4.26`. These verification results
> are historical records from the v0.4.2 debugging session.

---

## Evidence

- Source: `dsh-plugin/dsh/plugin.mjs` line 10 (before fix)
- Source: `dsh-plugin/lib/index.js` (missing inject)
- Source: `install.ps1` lines 85-108 (old patch-writing logic)
- Test: `dsh --profile web --dump-config` outputs `- id: project-memory-dsh`
- Test: npm registry (historical — v0.4.2当时); current published version is 0.4.26
- Git: commits `d7e7e73`, `c0cdc9e`, `332a704`

## Why It Matters

A future Agent debugging a DSH plugin boot failure will see one of these three errors. Without this document, they would need to:
1. Search DSH source code to understand `inject`
2. Trace through cordis-plugin-loader to understand patch layer merging
3. Manually test each hypothesis

This document compresses ~2 hours of debugging into a single reference.

---

## Future Guidance

**Diagnostic sequence for DSH plugin boot failures:**

```text
1. SyntaxError --> check plugin.mjs for unescaped */ in comments
2. duplicate loader entry id --> check both profile AND plugin cordis.patch.yml
3. cannot get property "X" without inject --> check lib/index.js for inject=['X']
4. ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND --> check package is installed
```

**Design rule:** A DSH bundle plugin must declare `inject` in its primary entry point. The module's `inject` array tells Cordis which services to resolve before calling `apply()`.

## Bug 4: False "no AGENTS.md" Init Hint (Fixed in v0.4.4)

### Problem

After installing the plugin, DSH shows:

> Project Memory: this workspace has no AGENTS.md yet -- run the
> `memory-architecture` skill to bootstrap the Project Knowledge System.

But AGENTS.md clearly exists in the workspace.

### Root Cause

`resolveWorkspace()` used the first non-empty `payload.cwd` as-is, without
verifying that AGENTS.md actually exists there. When the DSH web GUI runs
from its own directory (e.g. `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\pnpm\...`), the
plugin resolves to the wrong workspace and incorrectly triggers the
first-time init hint.

### Fix

Added an AGENTS.md existence check per candidate, with a walk-up search
(6 levels deep) from each candidate path. Falls back to `REPO_ROOT` when
no candidate has AGENTS.md.

```javascript
// Before (v0.4.3):
for (const c of candidates) {
  if (typeof c === 'string' && c.trim()) return c.trim()
}
return process.cwd()

// After (v0.4.4):
for (const c of candidates) {
  const trimmed = c.trim()
  if (existsSync(join(trimmed, 'AGENTS.md'))) return trimmed
  // Walk up looking for AGENTS.md
  let dir = trimmed
  for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    if (existsSync(join(dir, 'AGENTS.md'))) return dir
    const parent = dirname(dir)
    if (parent === dir) break
    dir = parent
  }
}
return REPO_ROOT
```

### Evidence

- npm: `@lovedolove/dsh-project-memory@0.4.4`
- Commit: `cb2bf22`
- Tests: 9/9 passed

## Bug 5: False Init Hint When Workspace Unresolvable (Fixed in v0.4.5)

### Problem

After v0.4.4's walk-up fix, DSH web still showed:

> Project Memory: this workspace has no AGENTS.md yet -- run the
> `memory-architecture` skill to bootstrap...

when opened from the DSH web GUI, even though AGENTS.md exists.

### Root Cause

`resolveWorkspace()` fell back to `REPO_ROOT` (the plugin package
directory: `node_modules/@lovedolove/dsh-project-memory`) when no
candidate cwd resolved. That directory has no AGENTS.md either, so
`needsInit()` returned `true` -> hint injected every session.

The real issue: DSH web GUI runs from its own directory
(`C:\Users\...\pnpm\bin\node.EXE` or `~/.dsh/profiles/web`), and
walking up 6 levels from there never reaches the user's project on a
different drive (`D:\Projects\...`).

### Fix

`resolveWorkspace()` now returns `null` instead of `REPO_ROOT` when no
workspace is found. The pre-step handler checks `if (workspace && ...)`
before injecting the init hint. When the workspace can't be determined,
no hint is shown.

The post-task hint was already safe (it checks AGENTS.md existence
before queuing).

```javascript
// Before:
return REPO_ROOT  // -> always has no AGENTS.md -> always shows hint

// After:
return null  // -> caller skips init-hint injection
```

### Why This Is Correct

The init hint is only meaningful when the agent is working in a project
that lacks AGENTS.md. When DSH can't determine the workspace (web GUI
without explicit project context), silently skipping is better than
showing a confusing hint about a directory that isn't the user's project.

Users in headless DSH or when DSH's payload.cwd correctly points to a
project directory will still get the init hint as expected.

## Bug 6: Retired `plugin` Message Source Kind (Unreleased)

### Problem

With the package-shadowing bug fixed (issue #1), `dsh` booted cleanly and the plugin loaded —
but **any conversation failed immediately**:

```
format v4 message requires a producer-owned source kind
```

The plugin had to be uninstalled to use DSH at all.

### Root Cause

Every injected message declared the same invented source:

```javascript
source: { kind: 'plugin', plugin: PLUGIN_ID, form: 'instructions' }
```

Session format v4 has **no catch-all `plugin` kind**. Each producer declares its own, and
admission refuses the retired value — `dsh-session-format-v3-to-v4` rejects `kind === "plugin"`
outright. The protocol's own migration states the canonical rule; `producerKind()` maps an
unknown plugin to `plugin:<plugin>` and drops the `plugin` field:

```javascript
function producerKind(plugin, role) {
  // ... rename tables for first-party producers ...
  return `plugin:${plugin}`
}
```

The static-context injection additionally used `form: 'context'`, which is not a member of the
protocol's `ContextForm` union.

### Fix

```javascript
// Before -- hand-rolled message, invented source
agent.inject({
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  role: 'user',
  content: [{ type: 'text', text }],
  source: { kind: 'plugin', plugin: PLUGIN_ID, form: 'context' },
})

// After -- the host's own factory, and the kind DSH's migration would produce
agent.inject(createUserMessage({
  content: [{ type: 'text', text }],
  source: { kind: `plugin:${PLUGIN_ID}`, form: 'instructions' },
}))
```

All six injection sites — four lifecycle hooks in `dsh/plugin.mjs` and both slash commands — now
use the host's `createUserMessage()`, which is reachable as a peer package through DSH's shared
core layer (see `docs/lessons/host-core-packages-are-peers.md`).

### Evidence

- Validator replay with the host's own `assertV4RowAdmission`:
  `{ kind: 'plugin', ... }` → REFUSE `format v4 message requires a producer-owned source kind`;
  `{ kind: 'plugin:dsh-project-memory', ... }` → ACCEPT.
- `test/integration/dsh-plugin-hooks.test.mjs` asserts the contract on every injected message.
- Issue: [#1](https://github.com/hyperion2144/Project-Memory-Agent/issues/1) (same install-and-boot session).

## Bug 7: Host-API Drift Against DSH 0.1.7-rc.2 (Unreleased)

### Problem

After the boot-breaking bugs were fixed, a systematic sweep of every host contract the
plugin binds to found three further mismatches. None of them crash — all three fail
**silently**, which is why they survived:

1. `/ema recall …`, `/ema status`, `/ema verify`, `/ema promote` all behaved as the plain
   `default` subcommand, and `/project-memory --trace` never enabled tracing.
2. The post-task compounding prompt (the plugin's `agent/post-step` hook) never fired.
3. Hook-driven context injection resolved its workspace from `process.cwd()` instead of the
   session's workspace.

### Root Cause

**1) `invocation.text` does not exist.** `CommandInvocation` carries `rawInput` (the text
after the command name, including separator whitespace), and nothing else. Both slash
commands read `invocation.text`, got `undefined`, and fell back to `''`.

```javascript
// Before -- field absent, value always undefined
const rawText = typeof invocation.text === 'string' ? invocation.text : ''
// After
const rawText = typeof invocation.rawInput === 'string' ? invocation.rawInput : ''
```

Underneath it sat a second defect: the flag regex could never match. `\b` asserts a word
boundary, and `-` is not a word character, so `\b--trace\b` is false for every realistic
input — including `/project-memory --trace`:

```javascript
// Before -- false for ' --trace', '/project-memory --trace', '--trace'
const hasTraceFlag = /\b--trace\b/.test(rawText)
// After
const hasTraceFlag = /(?:^|\s)--trace(?:\s|$)/.test(rawText)
```

`/ema recall --trace` was documented but never implemented, and the flag was joined into the
search query verbatim (searching for the literal `--trace`). It is now consumed as a
selector and answered with the same ephemeral trace instruction as `/project-memory --trace`.

**2) `agent/post-step` does not exist on DSH 0.1.7-rc.2.** The declared agent events are
`agent/pre-step`, `agent/request`, `agent/turn-stopping`, `agent/status`, `agent/created`,
`agent/disposed`, `agent/error`, `agent/request-error`, `agent/assistant-stream`. The hook was
registered on a name nothing emits, so the feature was dead code (and the payload field it
read, `payload.lastMessage`, does not exist either).

The port uses `agent/turn-stopping` — the agent-scoped turn-ending event that still carries
the agent — and reads the task text from `session.deriveMessages()`, skipping any message
whose source is a `plugin:*` producer so the plugin's own injections are not mistaken for the
user's task:

```javascript
on('agent/turn-stopping', (payload) => {
  const lastText = lastHumanText(payload?.agent)   // session.deriveMessages(), human sources only
  …
})
```

It is also **opt-in** now (`COMPOUNDING_ENABLED`), matching the contract the file header
always claimed; the old code defaulted to on while the hook never ran.

**3) The `agent/pre-step` payload carries no `cwd`.** It is
`{ agent, messages, turn, step, signal }`. `resolveWorkspace()` probed `payload.session` and
`payload.agent.cwd`, neither of which exists, so every hook-driven injection fell through to
`process.cwd()` — the directory DSH was launched from, not the agent's workspace. The
authoritative value is `payload.agent.session.header.cwd` (`SessionHeader.cwd`), now probed
first.

### Verified compatible (no change needed)

`CommandResult` (`{ kind: 'success', text? }`), the `agent/pre-step` waterfall including its
`next()` contract, `ctx.skills.register` / `ctx.skills.registerProvider`, `defineTool` options
and `ctx.tools.register`, `WebRoute { kind: 'prefix', path, handler }`, `agent.inject` /
`agent.followup`, and `agent.session.header.cwd`.

### Evidence

- `test/integration/dsh-plugin-hooks.test.mjs` covers all three: `rawInput` subcommand parsing,
  opt-in `agent/turn-stopping` compounding, and a workspace marker that only the session cwd
  carries (a `process.cwd()` fallback cannot satisfy it).
- The `--trace` regex defect is demonstrated by `/\b--trace\b/.test(' --trace') === false`.
